    <section>
      <p>Welcome to <strong>BctFour4 Cazzinno</strong>. This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, disclose, and protect your information when you use our mobile application and related services (collectively, the "App"). By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>
    </section>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We may collect the following types of information:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Personal Information:</strong> Information that identifies you personally, such as your name, email address, phone number, or account identifiers, when you provide them directly (for example, when you contact support or register an account).</li>
      <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Information about your interactions with the App, such as pages/screens viewed, features used, error logs, device model, operating system, app version, and timestamps.</li>
      <li><strong>Device Data:</strong> Technical information about your device (e.g., device identifiers, IP address, mobile carrier, language, and time zone).</li>
      <li><strong>Analytics & Cookies:</strong> We and third-party analytics providers may use cookies or similar technologies to collect information about how you use the App to improve functionality and performance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide, maintain, and improve the App and its features;</li>
      <li>Respond to your inquiries and provide customer support;</li>
      <li>Analyze usage trends and diagnose technical issues;</li>
      <li>Prevent fraud, abuse, and security incidents;</li>
      <li>Comply with legal obligations and enforce our rights.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <p>We may share your information in the following circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> Third-party vendors who perform services on our behalf (e.g., analytics, hosting, customer support). These parties are contractually restricted from using your information for other purposes.</li>
      <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> When required by law, court order, or government request, or to protect our rights, safety, or property.</li>
      <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> In connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction, subject to reasonable notice.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services & Links</h2>
    <p>The App may use third-party services (such as analytics and crash reporting). These services have their own privacy policies and may collect information about your use of the App. We encourage you to review the privacy practices of those third parties. The App may also include links to external sites or services; we are not responsible for their privacy practices.</p>

    <h2>5. Cookies and Similar Technologies</h2>
    <p>We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies to operate and improve the App. You can control certain cookie settings through your device preferences. Mobile apps typically do not support the same cookie controls as web browsers; consult your device settings for privacy and tracking controls.</p>

    <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain personal information only as long as necessary to provide the App and services, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce agreements. When information is no longer needed, we will delete or anonymize it in a secure manner.</p>

    <h2>7. Security</h2>
    <p>We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect your information. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security. If we become aware of a data breach affecting personal information, we will take steps in accordance with applicable law.</p>

    <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we learn that we have collected information from a child under 13, we will take steps to delete that information. If you believe we might have collected information from a child under 13, please contact us at the address below.</p>

    <h2>9. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
    <p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights regarding your personal information, such as the right to access, correct, restrict processing of, or delete your personal information. You may also have the right to object to certain processing and to request data portability. To exercise these rights, contact us at the email below. We will respond in accordance with applicable law.</p>

    <h2>10. International Transfers</h2>
    <p>Your information may be processed and stored in countries other than your country of residence. When transferring information internationally, we will use appropriate safeguards required by applicable law.</p>

    <h2>11. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will update the effective date above and provide notice within the App or by other means as required by applicable law. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
